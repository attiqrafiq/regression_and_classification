Assignment Part 1: Basic Analysis and Core Models
Instructions (Basic):
1.	Dataset Selection and Loading:
o	Choose a dataset relevant to your field of study. Ensure it’s publicly available or you have permission to use it. If yet not decides then you can use data from (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository).
o	Aim for a dataset with a reasonable size (e.g., several hundred to thousands of rows) to allow for meaningful analysis.
o	Load the dataset using Pandas.
o	Identify the target variable and features.
2.	Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Display basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation).
o	Create histograms for numerical features.
o	Create bar plots for categorical features.
o	Check for missing values.
3.	Data Preprocessing (Simplified):
o	Handle missing values using simple imputation (mean or most frequent).
o	Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
o	Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20).
o	Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
4.	Core Model Training and Evaluation:
o	Train and evaluate the following models: 
	Decision Tree
	Random Forest
	SVM.
o	Use accuracy, F1-Score, RoC-AUC and classification report (for classification) or MSE/RMSE (for regression) as evaluation metrics.
5.	Basic Results Presentation:
o	Present the accuracy/error metrics for each model.
o	Provide a simple comparison table.
Basic Code Example:
Given in code portion. Consider this just for your basic understanding and basic template. You can add more if you think it should be.
